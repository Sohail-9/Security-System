# Security System (C++) : This project implements a basic security system using C++.

**This is a work in progress, but it currently provides a starting point for a security system.
Running the System:**

## Prerequisites:

* A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) 
* A text editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) 

## Compilation:

* Save the code as security_system.cpp (or any filename with the .cpp extension).

* Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

* Compile the code using the following command (replace g++ with your compiler if it's different):

```
g++ main.cpp -o security
```
* Use code with caution content_copy

**This will create an executable file named security.**

## Execution:

**Run the program by typing the following command in your terminal:**

```
./security
```

## Expected Output:

**The program should currently print "Hiii" to the console, indicating a successful startup.**

## Future Enhancements:


* User authentication (login/logout)

* Integration with sensors (door/window, motion detection)

* Alarm functionalities

* Logging and notification systems
